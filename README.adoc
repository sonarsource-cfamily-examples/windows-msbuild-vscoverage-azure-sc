*The test coverage shown here works on both SonarQube and SonarCloud. This project is analysed on https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=sonarsource-cfamily-examples_windows-vscoverage-msbuild-azure-sc[SonarCloud]!*

NOTE: This simple example aims at demonstrating code coverage in action. It explains how to add coverage on a project for which the analysis is already configured. Some analysis https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples?q=azure+topic%3Amsbuild[configuration examples] are available. +
Adding code coverage is done the same way regardless of whether you use the Build Wrapper or a Compilation Database to configure the analysis.

To get coverage and feed it to the Sonar Scanner, use the following procedure.

. In your azure-pipelines.yml file, initialize the extra property `sonar.cfamily.vscoveragexml.reportsPath` with the path that will contain your XML coverage report
. Add a `VSTest` task to launch your tests. Be sure to enable code coverage and to convert the result file into an XML file
. Make sure the `SonarCloudAnalyze` task runs after the `VSTest` task

You can take a look at the link:sonar-project.properties[sonar-project.properties] and link:azure-pipelines.yml[azure-pipelines.yml] to see it in practice.

= Code Description

An example of a flawed C++ code. The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] can be https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/automatic-analysis-sc[analyzed automatically], but it can also be compiled with different build systems using different CI pipelines on Linux, macOS, and Windows.

The https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples/code[code repository] is forked into other repositories in https://github.com/sonarsource-cfamily-examples[this collection] to add a specific build system, platform, and CI.
The downstream repositories are analyzed either with https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] or https://sonarcloud.io/[SonarCloud].
